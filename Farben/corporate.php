				<b>FARBEN Automatic Watering System</b> was established in year 2005. It specializes in the development, manufacture and marketing of small household automation equipments and systems to enhance the modern lifestyle. Within a short period of 3 years, Farben has evolved into a supplier with a complete range of garden automation products. The smallest is a DIY set that cater for a small balcony in condominiums. The larger systems are for commercial projects such as holiday resorts, parks and vegetable farms. The in-betweens such as systems for offices (indoor), residential properties - link, semi-detached and detached houses have recently become very popular. We manufacture watering sets and offer installation service (design, install and maintain) to local customers. Practical experiences gained in installation have been incorporated in product development. Our automatic DIY sets are practical; user friendly automatic sets with the highest performance and reliability.<br/><br/>

						<td width="95%">Our first automatic watering system - Auto Patio / Balcony set was developed and marketed to cater mostly for potted hanging and indoor plants. The 1 mm micro-tubes used in this system is not easily noticeable and as a result this system is popular for indoor application.<br/><br/></td>

						<td width="5%" valign="top"><b>2007</b>: </td>
						<td width="95%">Garden set was developed for customers with flower beds. The functionality was further enhanced with a variety of water dispensing fittings to cater for more complex landscapes. This enable "on-target" watering for better end results and more effective water use for maximum cost savings. Also the tubes could be easily concealed or buried and water can be drawn from any point along the main tube.<br/><br/></td>

						<td width="5%" valign="top"><b>2007</b>: </td>
						<td width="95%">The pop-up sprinkler system was developed and introduced to the market to cater for lawns. Tubes and sprinklers are entirely buried.<br/><br/></td>

						<td width="5%" valign="top"><b>2008</b>: </td>
						<td width="95%">The tank system was developed and marketed recently to cater for customers who intend to automate areas that do not have water source. This system was later modified for hobbyist to grow vegetables and herbs with the option to add fertiliser to the water in the tank.<br/><br/></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Since then, more varieties of water dispensing parts have been added on. Farben system can automate almost any variations e.g. pots on the wall, green houses and orchid sheds and even orchid hanging from or growing on tree branches.<br/><br/>

				Farben is in the forefront of product development. We have recently collaborated with landscaping companies to develop a cost effective automatic system for watering and fertigation for vegetative walls which is getting increasingly popular in high end condominiums and shopping complexes.<br/><br/>
				
				Cheap and convenient fertigation unit add-ons to Farben system is recently made available. For customers demanding more functionality, we have recently introduces a new range to timers with dual power source and with rain sensor. The same timer is adaptable to control valves of various sizes from 0.5" to 2".<br/><br/>
				
				Farben products are distributed both in the domestic market and the export market.

				<b>FARBEN AUTOMATIC WATERING SYSTEM<br/>
				has revolutionized the auto watering system through the following:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Introduction of 1mm micro tubing to revolutionize watering of hanging plants. These tubes can hardly be seen, thus a very attractive proposition for hanging plants, potted and indoor plants.</li>
					<li>Introduction of HDPE underground tubing enables a system that last 30 years.</li>
					<li>Use of tube joints that can withstand high pressure without leaks due to aging of plastic.</li>
					<li>Farben systems can functions <b><i>WITHOUT PUMPS</i></b>. Pressure from the water supply mains is adequate in most households. That negates the use of pumps and water tanks as required by most standard systems. It saves costs, space and maintenance costs.</li>
					<li>Introduction of 1/2" MDPE tubes where water can be drawn anywhere along the tube. The joints can withstand water pressure at 4 bars. With this breakthrough, it is now possible drive mist sprinklers in Farben Systems as compared to rotating sprinklers for conventional systems. </li>
					<li>Farben system systems run at higher pressure and they are therefore higher capacity and more effective.</li>
					<li>Farben system allows staggered watering area by area. This can potentially reduce the pump size and main tubing size by up to a factor of 20 times as compared to traditional systems.</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<b>New Development in the pipeline:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Mosquito repellent dispenser in gardens. This system knocks out all mosquitoes in the garden</li>
					<li>Grey water recovery for use in watering plant in water scarce places such as Middle East countries and Australia</li>
				</ul>
