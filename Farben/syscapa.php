				<div class="CmpagePgbc">
				Farben system is one of the most flexible systems with capabilities exceeding many makes that you can get from the market. The capabilities are as follows: <br/><br/>

				<ol type="1">
					<li>Can automate the most complicated landscape - both vertical and horizontal landscapes.<br/>
						- a wide range of water dispensing heads ranging from micro tubes, drippers, micro sprinkler of various sizes with versions for hanging and sticking on the ground and a range of pop-up sprinklers.<br/>
						- the above used in combination with our system with water flow control manifolds and valves enable balancing of water supplies to different levels.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Can automate potted plants, planter boxes, flower beds, lawns, hanging plants, plants growing on tree branches, greenhouses, hanging pots etc.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Suitable for indoor application.<br/>
						- Leak proof joints that can be heat treated during installation.<br/>
						-1mm tubes not obvious when installed in pots solved the problem of unsightly tubes around the pots.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Can be attached to a fertilizer dispenser to deliver water and fertilizer to the plants simultaneously.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Drippers have flow regulation capability to deliver the right amount of water to pots/ plants of different sizes.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Miniature misting sprinklers with various angle spray heads allow perfect fit to the landscape.<br/>
						- Saves water through effective and on target distribution.<br/>
						- the spray can fit into any shape in accordance to the landscape.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Low maintenance cost through use of sprinklers with detachable heads.<br/>
						- Sprinkler and dripper heads can be cleaned or replaced easily.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Can automate areas with or without water source.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Use of superior compression joints enables tolerance of higher water pressure.<br/>
						- High operating pressure gives more capacity to the line and supports the use of fogging and misting sprays.<br/>
						- The system can last longer as compared to "common slip-on" in joints.<br/>
						- Compression joints are less prone to leaks. Leaks can cause loss of pressure leading to complete failure of the system.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>We have a special version where water can be drawn anywhere along the main tube by punching hole, inserting a joint into the hole. Secondary tubes can be connected from this joint or water dispensing assessories can be directly inserted into the punched hole. Superior material and joints design enables higher operating pressure. The joints for Farben system can widthstand 4 bars without leaks.<br/>
						- This system is simple and installation costs are very low.<br/>
						- The main tubes could be easily buried. This helps to keep your garden neat.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>No need for electrical wires (timers are battery operated).<br/><br/></li>
					<li>No need for tanks and pumps. Our drip system operates with pressure of 0.1 bars. Spraying dispensers requires minimum pressure of 2 bars. Water supply mains in most households are normally 2 bars or higher.<br/><br/></li>
					<li>Farben systems allow watering the garden one part at a time. This can reduce the pump size and the main supply pipe size by up to a factor of 20 times.</li>
