				<b><a name="q1">1. I cannot turn my timer on manual or change the program.</a></b><br/>
				You have probably disabled the screen. <br/>
				This screen lock feature (child proof) is for you to prevent accidental alteration the program when they someone fiddles with the timer.<br/>
				Just press ESC key continuously for 5 seconds. <br/>
				The screen will unlock. <br/>
				If you do the same again, the screen will be locked.<br/><br/>
				
				<b><a name="q2">2. My timer does not open and close at the programmed time.</a></b><br/>
				You have probably introduced new programs unintentionally. <br/>
				This can happen when you accidentally touch the hour or min key when you are navigating the program. <br/>
				Go through your program to make sure the active slots have both opening and closing time.<br/>
				Delete all the unused slots by pressing the ESC key.<br/><br/>				
				<b>IMPORTANT:</b>  If you have opening time and no closing time, water will flow non stop.<br/><br/>
				
				<b><a name="q3">3. How often does my timer need maintenance?</a></b><br/>
				In theory, there is no need for maintenance if the water is 100% particle free. However, that is not possible. Sometimes there might be rust particles in the piping or particles formed as a result of flocculation of smaller particles. Micro organisms in the pipe will also build up solid material. These solids may build up at the strainer before the timer causing high pressure drop. Apart from filter blockage, the orifice in the opening and shutting mechanism can cause malfunction if blocked.<br/>
				Cleaning the internals once in 3 to 6 months should be sufficient.<br/>
				The new ball valve type of timer is not affected by presence of solid particles and no cleaning is necessary.<br/><br/>
				
				<b><a name="q4">4. My drip system sometimes malfunctions. Some micro tubes have very low flows or no flow.</a></b><br/>
				Your system has air in it. Air will cause malfunctioning. Air bubbles in the system will restrict flow. Particularly for gravity feed system where there is little pressure to force air bubbles out. <br/>
				The following are good practices to keep air bubbles out.<br/><br/>				
				A. Make sure the 1mm tube outlets are not below the level of the 4mm tubes. Otherwise air will go in when the water flows out when the timer is off.<br/><br/>					
				B. Make sure the water in the tank does not go totally empty. <br/><br/>					
				C. Make sure that air is forced out when you commission the system. This can be done by running the system for 10 to 15 minutes or longer. Check the flow of each of the micro tubes<br/><br/>				
				D. You can beat the tube against the floor or pot to remove air.<br/><br/>					
				It is also not advisable to shut down the micro tube system for too long. When water dries up, it leaves deposits behind. Also insects such as ants and hornets might make their nests and the end result will be blocked tubes.<br/><br/>
				
				<b><a name="q5">5. It is very difficult to fit my 4mm tubes to the joints.</a></b><br/>
				To ensure 100% leak proof, the tube to joint connections must be very tight and you will need a fair bit of force to put it on. Fortunately, plastics soften with temperature. Therefore you can make the job easy by heating the end of the tube over a cigarette lighter or candle flame for 2 -3 seconds before you attempt to put on the joints. The plastic hardens when cooled and you will have a leak proof joint. Try and you will be pleased with the result.<br/><br/>
				
				<b><a name="q6">6. The threaded joints sometimes leaks. How do I overcome the problem?</a></b><br/>
				Before you attempt to join 2 threaded parts that do not have a rubber washer in between, you will need to put 15 to 20 rounds of PTFE tapes around it. The PTFE tapes are soft and its function is to seal off all available gaps between the threads. If you feel some resistance when you screw the parts together, there is a goo chance the joint will not leak. If it is loose, add more tape. Do the leak tests for the joints before you work on other sections.<br/><br/>
				
				<b><a name="q7">7. My pop-up sprinkler works fine but at times it does not pop up.</a></b><br/>
				There must be a reduction of water pressure in you pipeline. Most likely there is other consumer sharing the same line that is turned on at the same time. Another possibility could be the float valve at the water tank is open for water replenishment. Turn on the pop-up again in the late hour after your storage tank is full. If the same problem persists, check the joints from the timer to the pop up sprinkler to check for leaks.<br/><br/>
				
				<b><a name="q8">8. My pop-up sprinkler cannot retract after some months of usage.</a></b><br/>
				After a period of usage, moving parts need lubrication. Putting a few drops of your left over car engine lubricating oil at the base of your pop-up (when in operation) will do the trick. The moving parts need oiling from time to time.
