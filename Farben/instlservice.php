				<b>Installation Services</b><br/><br/>
				
				Farben has developed a team of professionals capable of carrying out design and specification that will meet specific requirements. We can undertake "turn-key" projects. In this type of arrangement, Farben will ensure the system will perform as specified. With the experience gained from numerous projects, systems installed by Farben will be optimal. Farben has the knowhow and the equipments to ensure good finishing. For example we have the machinery to cut through your lawn to install underground pipes without loosening the soil and thus causing no damages to your lawn. Others included crimping devices, drills and diamond cutters etc that enable us conceal tubing in the wall.<br/><br/>
				
				We have computer softwares that will help us fit the best combinations of sprinklers in your garden, estimate the material quantity and costs. This will enable us do things right the first time. The accuracy in estimation means we do not build big buffers for contingencies. Our workers undergo training to familiarize with our installation process which are well documented and closely adhered to. As a result we can deliver the best quality and an optimal system for your garden.<br/><br/>
				
				A typical plan for a project is as follows:<br/><br/>
