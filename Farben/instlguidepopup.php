	The garden set is similar to the patio set except  that it has an extra set to 3/4" tubing and fittings to bring larger volume of water to the plants. The manifolds can be located near to where the plants are. Moreover, the timer can also be used to its full capacity. You can add another 3 to 4 manifolds to the system to use up 100% of the timer capacity.<br/>
	All accessories for add-ons are available.
